    <h2 class="middle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>

    <h2 class="middle">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  </li>
        <li> Make cheesecake layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition. </li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup batter in the graham cracker crust. </li>
        <li>Make pumpkin layer: Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the remaining batter; stir gently until well blended. </li>
        <li>Carefully spread on top of plain cheesecake batter in the crust. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are puffed and the surface is firm except for a small spot in the center that jiggled when the pan is gently shaken, 35 to 40 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. </li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, preferably overnight. </li>
